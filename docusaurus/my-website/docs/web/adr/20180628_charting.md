# Charting

## Status

accepted

## Context

Charting is going to be a key part of the app curator application, so we'll need to carefully
consider the various libraries and options to choose something that will scale well and suit our
potential needs.

Some of our most important considerations for a charting library are:

- Can create standard chart types out of the box e.g. bar, line, pie etc.
- Ability to create more bespoke charts with customized design and appearance.
- High performance.
- Supports interactivity, and is responsive.
- Balance between flexibility and ease of use.
- Minimal file size.

## Decision

We've considered a number of charting libraries such as [Vega](https://github.com/vega/vega),
[Victory](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory) and
[Recarts](https://github.com/recharts/recharts), though many either don't play well with React, or
they don't provide the level of customization and flexibility that we'll need. Given we don't want
to end up restricting ourselves on the types of charts we can produce in the future, we've decided
to go with [D3](https://D3js.org/).

D3 is often considered the standard library for data visualization on the web. D3 meets all of our
criteria, with perhaps the only exception being ease of use. D3 is highly flexible, however because
the library is so extensive and low level there is a pretty hefty learning curve.

When it comes to integrating D3 with React, there are a number of approaches, discussed in detail in
[this article](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/02/react-d3-ecosystem/). To summarize the
article, D3 provides low level functions to take data and convert it into a form which can be mapped
to elements on the screen. However it also comes with a set of DOM manipulating functions which can
interpret the transformed data to add, remove and transition elements on the DOM. Because of this,
both React and D3 can clash, and we should only allow either React or D3 to manipulate the DOM to
avoid conflicts.

D3 is split into multiple sub modules, many of which don't relate to the DOM. This allows use to use
only those modules from D3 which manipulate data and perform complex mathematical calculations. We
then use React to render the chart to the DOM, based on the calculations performed on the data.
Another benefit of this approach is we only need to bring in what we need from D3, reducing the file
size impact. The core modules from D3 that we'll need are
[d3-array](https://github.com/d3/d3-array), [d3-ease](https://github.com/d3/d3-ease),
[d3-scale](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale), [d3-shape](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape),
[d3-time-format](https://github.com/d3/d3-time-format), totalling 104KB / 31KB zipped.

## Consequences

While there is a decent learning curve, D3 is highly adopted and well documented with lots of
examples. By choosing D3 we can be confident that we'll be able produce any type of chart that might
be required in the future.
