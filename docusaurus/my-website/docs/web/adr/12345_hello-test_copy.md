# Modular JS Architecture

## Status

accepted

## Context

Traditionally web app development has required front-end developers to work across a wide range of
feature sets under a single monolithic code base.

With our move to teams working autonomously on vertical feature sets we find the monolith approach
at odds with this methodology and prevents teams working independently.
