Although `react-intl` seems to be the most popular library according to [usage][8], `i18next` has
all the right ingredients for building a reliable, scalable, cross-platform i18n solution and also
seems to be gaining in [popularity][9].

`i18next` has a handy [namespace][10] feature which can be used to split translations across
files.`i18next` also has a localisation management [solution][11] which can be leveraged if
required.

The `i18next` library requires 2 packages to be included `i18next` and `react-i18next` with a total
size slightly higher than `react-intl`.

Apart from the above, other options looked at include [react-intl-universal][12], [LinguiJS][13] and
[FBT][14].
