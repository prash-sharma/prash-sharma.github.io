Welcome to the mtribes developer hub!

This document contains everything you'll need to know about integrating mtribes into your apps. Ready? Let's go.

## SDK guides
First complete these two steps. This initial setup is common across all SDKs.

1. [Install the CLI](#cli-installation)
2. [Connect to your mtribes Space](#space-integration)

Next, follow the specific documentation for your platform to complete the integration.

* [Browser](sdk/client/browser.md)
* [Android](sdk/client/android.md)
* [iOS](sdk/client/ios.md)

We're working hard on expanding our platform support, so stay tuned for updates.

## CLI installation

This is the first step. We've purpose-built a command-line-interface (CLI) to automate most of the process, and help integrate your mtribes Space quickly and accurately.

### CLI install

<Tabs
  groupId = 'macos'
  defaultValue="macos"
  values={[
        { label: 'macOS', value: 'macos', },
        { label: 'Windows', value: 'windows', },
    ]
    }>
<TabItem value="macos"><p>Install via <a href='https://brew.sh/' target='_blank'> Homebrew </a></p>

```bash
brew install mtribes/tap/mtribes
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="windows"><p>Install via <a href='https://scoop.sh/' target='_blank'> Scoop </a></p>

```bash
scoop bucket add mtribes https://github.com/mtribes/cli.git
scoop install mtribes
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


### CLI upgrade

<Tabs
  groupId = 'macos'
  defaultValue="macos"
  values={[
        { label: 'macOS', value: 'macos', },
        { label: 'Windows', value: 'windows', },
    ]
}>
<TabItem value="macos"><p>Upgrade the CLI at anytime via <a href='https://brew.sh/' target='_blank'> Homebrew </a></p>

```bash
brew upgrade mtribes
```
    
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="windows"><p>Upgrade the CLI at anytime via <a href='https://scoop.sh/' target='_blank'> Scoop </a></p>

```shell
scoop update mtribes
```
</TabItem>     
</Tabs>


## Space integration

This is the second step. Let's get you connected with the mtribes Space you want to target before diving into the code.


### Space setup

With the CLI installed, you can now set up your Space integration by running the following command in the root folder of your project.

```bash
mtribes setup
```

The first time you run setup, you'll be prompted to enter your secret API key to authenticate with mtribes. Your secret key is located on your organization's <a href="https://mtribes.com/developer/settings" target='_blank'>settings page</a>. **You'll need to be an administrator to access this page.**

Once authenticated, follow the remaining prompts to configure your connection.

1. Select the mtribes Space to integrate with.
2. Choose a target language if the default is incorrect.
3. Decide where code should be output if the default location is incorrect.

The CLI will now generate Space specific integration code for you to use.

An `mtribes.yaml` file containing your saved preferences will be written to the root of your project .

**Both mtribes.yaml and the generated code should be committed to source control.**

:::note DEPENDENCIES
Where possible, the CLI will automatically add a dependency to our core SDK library, which the generated code will leverage.
:::

### Space update
As updates are made to Collection, Experience and Section templates in your mtribes Space, you'll need to synchronize these changes with your codebase so you can integrate them.

You can regenerate code at any point, so that it reflects the latest state of your Space via the CLI's `update` command.


```bash
mtribes update
```
