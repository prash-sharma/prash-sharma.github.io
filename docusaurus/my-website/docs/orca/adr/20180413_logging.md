# Logging

## Status

accepted

## Context

In order to help diagnose and alert production issues with Orca quickly, we need a robust logging
library.

It should provide log levels, output in a JSON format and be performant. Logging should have minimal
impact on server load.

## Decision

We looked at the following popular logging libraries.

* [Debug](https://github.com/visionmedia/debug)
* [Bole](https://github.com/rvagg/bole)
* [Bunyan](https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan)
* [Pino](https://getpino.io)
* [Winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston)

With prior experience using `Bunyan` that was an obvious choice. It logs in JSON format making
searching log files easy in many tools, including [CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch)
which we currently use.

A [little more digging](https://www.nearform.com/blog/cost-logging) found that `Pino` appears to be
the most performant and outputs natively in JSON as we require. It also has some useful extensions
we may be able to use like [express-pino-logger](https://github.com/pinojs/express-pino-logger).

For this reason we'll go with `Pino` to output logs.

Because we're using `GraphQL` requests are mostly POST'd and most response codes hidden in the body
of a response. This will likely require custom `Express` middleware to ensure we log the correct
information.

## Consequences

This should provide logs for all request / response traffic, as well as orchestrated traffic to
backend services, that can be consumed by machines or humans.
