# Roku SDK

This guide explains how to integrate an mtribes Space into your Roku application.

You'll learn how to synchronize changes from your Space into your codebase using our CLI's code generation, and how to use this code to control the UX of your end users.

## Requirements

1. A Roku SceneGraph project ready to integrate with mtribes
2. An mtribes Space with at least one Collection and Experience
3. The mtribes CLI installed
4. Roku SceneGraph code generated for your Space

Our SDK is designed for use in Roku SceneGraph applications that use rsg_version=1.2 in their 'manifest' file and are ready to work with Roku OS version 9.2 and higher
