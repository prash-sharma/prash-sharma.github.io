# Android SDK

This guide explains how to integrate an mtribes Space into your Android application.

You'll learn how to synchronize changes from your Space into your codebase using our CLI's code generation, and how to use this code to control the UX of your end users.

## Requirements

1. An Android project ready to integrate with mtribes
2. An mtribes Space with at least one Collection and Experience
3. The mtribes CLI installed
4. Android code generated for your Space

Our SDK is designed to use in modern Android applications with support for backward compatibility, up to devices running API 21(Android 5.0).
