# iOS SDK

This guide explains how to integrate an mtribes Space into your iOS application.

You'll learn how to synchronize changes from your Space into your codebase using our CLI's code generation, and how to use this code to control the UX of your end users.

Additionally you can clone and run a sample application that uses the SDK.

## Requirements

1. Xcode 11.0+
2. An iOS project ready to integrate with mtribes
3. An mtribes Space with at least one Collection and Experience
4. The mtribes CLI installed
5. Swift code generated for your Space

Our SDK is designed to use in modern iOS applications with support for backward compatibility, up to devices running iOS 10.0.
